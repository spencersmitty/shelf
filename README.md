## about shelf  

**shelf** is a reimagined take on openemu ‚Äî built exclusively for modern macs and apple silicon in an apple style.

i‚Äôm still learning swift and figuring things out as i go, so this is a slow burn project.  
if you actually know what you‚Äôre doing and want to contribute, then **help is strongly welcomed.**

## ü´ß design philosophy  

i aim for simplicity and avoiding monotinous routines of researching a frontends ins and outs before you start playing. i hope to design this hopes of more user-friendliness and ease of use like an apple native app would behave. a majority of frontends arent designed for macOS first, and, most of them are *in my opinon* a bit too dressed up in attempts to *feel* "nostalgic" lol

the interface is built to stay out of the way. options only appear when they make sense, not scattered all around and overwhelming you. settings are lean, and graphical improvements are pre-configured and more easily understandable with photo examples. nobody should have to visit youtube in hopes to understand how to setup their core, when they really just want to play something.

the ‚Äúshelf‚Äù view is what ties it all together. while traditional views, you can also view your collection on a 3D front-facing shelf - sooo... cartridges, jewel cases, and boxes :-)
it‚Äôs a small touch, but it makes browsing feel warm and familiar. i'm pretty sure launchbox sort of touches on this idea with box art renders, im not too sure tho

or, what if there was a mechanic to wipe accumilated dust from your shelf, use isopropyl alcohol on your roms to make them read more frequently, and have to solder new capacitors into your virtual consoles? what a nightmare that would be right?! ermm
