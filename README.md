## about shelf  

**shelf** is a magical retro gaming frontend for macOS - built for apple silicon. it‚Äôs being created to bring the ease and polish of real hardware into emulation, removing setup friction so more people can enjoy games from a previous era. while many emulators are already great, shelf aims to offer a more apple-like experience: clean, familiar, and thoughtfully designed for mac users.

i‚Äôm still learning swift and figuring things out as i go, so this is a slow burn project.  
if you actually know what you‚Äôre doing and want to contribute, then **help is strongly welcomed.**

## ü´ß design philosophy  

i aim for simplicity and avoiding monotinous routines of researching a frontends ins and outs before you start playing. i hope to design this hopes of more user-friendliness and ease of use like an apple native app would behave. a majority of frontends arent designed for macOS first, and, most of them are *in my opinon* a bit too dressed up in attempts to *feel* "nostalgic" lol

the interface is built to stay out of the way. options only appear when they make sense, not scattered all around and overwhelming you. settings are lean, and graphical improvements are pre-configured and more easily understandable with photo examples. nobody should have to visit youtube in hopes to understand how to setup their core, when they really just want to play something.

the optional ‚Äúshelf‚Äù view is what ties it all together. while traditional grid views are more efficient and what i'd end up using anyway, in this view you'll be able to view your collection on a 3D front-facing shelf - seeing the jewel cases, cartridges, etc. it‚Äôs a small touch, but it will make choosing something to play feel a bit warmer and more interactive like reality.
